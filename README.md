##⚡ SmartOps – Mini Java Task Automation Project


##🌱 Why I Built This

When I started learning Java beyond textbooks, I realized I wanted to see how real-world systems manage multiple operations—not just isolated programs.

I wanted to understand:

How tasks succeed or fail in sequence.

How dependencies between tasks are handled.

How to design systems that are resilient and maintainable.

SmartOps became my mini playground to experiment with Java OOP, abstraction, and task management—all in a way that feels like real-world software.


##🧩 What SmartOps Does

SmartOps is a task runner framework in Java. You can:

Create different tasks (emails, payments, reports).

Define dependencies between tasks (e.g., generate a report only if payment succeeds).

Run all tasks, with retries and failure handling built-in.

Get a final report showing which tasks succeeded and which failed.

Think of it as a tiny operations manager, built entirely in Java, that mirrors challenges real systems face.


##⏳ When It’s Useful

This project is ideal when you want to:

Learn Java OOP design in a meaningful, hands-on way.

Simulate real-world operations without complex enterprise systems.

Build a base project that can grow: adding logging, real emails, database storage, or even a GUI.

For me, it was a moment of “learning by doing” — stepping beyond theory into practical problem-solving.


##⚙️ How It Works

OperationTask (Interface): The contract all tasks must follow.

AbstractTask (Abstract Class): Provides shared logic and structure for all tasks.

Concrete Tasks: PaymentTask, EmailTask, ReportTask — each simulates a real-world operation.

TaskManager: Handles execution, retries, dependencies, and the final report.

MainClass: Entry point where tasks are created, linked, and executed.

Every piece is designed to show the thought process behind real-world system design.

## 🚀 Example Run
---------

public class MainClass {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        TaskManager manager = new TaskManager();

        OperationTask payment = new PaymentTask("Order#1234 Payment", 2500.50);
        OperationTask email = new EmailTask("Welcome Email", "rahul@example.com", "Welcome to SmartOps 🚀");
        OperationTask report = new ReportTask("Daily Sales Report", "Sales");

        manager.addTask(payment);
        manager.addTask(email);
        manager.addTask(report);

        manager.addDependency(payment, report);   // Only generate report if payment succeeds

        manager.runAll();
    }
}

--------
Sample Output 

=== Smart Operations Manager ===

[RUNNING] Order#1234 Payment
[SUCCESS] Order#1234 Payment

[RUNNING] Daily Sales Report
[SUCCESS] Daily Sales Report

[RUNNING] Welcome Email
[SUCCESS] Welcome Email

=== Final Report ===
✔️ Successful Tasks: Payment, Report, Email
❌ Failed Tasks: None

##🌟 What Did I Learn?

How abstract classes and interfaces simplify extensibility.

Why dependencies and retry logic matter in real-world systems.

How to design code for growth (easy to add new tasks).

The importance of reporting & error handling.

##🚧 Future Improvements

- This project can evolve into something even more powerful:

- Add a logging framework (instead of System.out.println).

- Connect tasks to a real email service / payment gateway.

- Store reports in a database or as JSON.

- Add a simple GUI for triggering tasks interactively.
